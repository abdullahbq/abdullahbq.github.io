        <p class="nonindent">Today, every device (communication) is getting connected to the Internet or with a public
            network to do everyday/daily tasks. These devices/smart devices (Internet of Things devices) are creating a
            lot of data that has features like veracity, volume, value, and so on. Many applications/sectors (using
            these devices) like consumer products, retail, banking, insurance, automotive, and so on, are getting
            several cyber-attacks or vulnerabilities. We need to detect these attacks in the minimum time to avoid
            maximum loss. Note that if this attack occurs in a critical business or sector like healthcare, it may be
            cost us losing someone’s life. Since decades, cyber security is a primary concern for online users/active
            users on the web. But today’s cyber security is the need of the hour because it is the need of every
            industry/business. We are looking forward to provide innovative solutions to avoid such attacks or
            vulnerabilities, mitigated on a public network/infrastructure using artificial intelligence. IoTs produce
            huge amount of data which is stores in cloud and can be accessed anywhere, anytime with valid/authorised
            users. To secure this data, this article discusses the uses of <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>
            (<strong>AI</strong>) in intrusion detection/vulnerability detection, and so on, and reduces the workload of
            cyber-security professionals. Also, various other points like benefits, pitfalls, future uses, and other
            possible uses of AI in some other sectors also have been discussed in this chapter.</p>

        <p class="nonindent">Today AI is the most popular term of computer science (in recent development of technology)
            which is being used with almost all possible applications like agriculture, transportation, logistics,
            healthcare, and so on. In general, AI provides automation with IoT devices and intelligence using learning
            capabilities (using ML and DL techniques). Hence, AI can be used by ethical hackers to mitigate
            cyber-attacks or to perform cyber-attacks or to stop cyber-attacks. Such essential concepts will be
            explained in this chapter in detail for readers/researchers.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s85"><a href="toc.xhtml#s85a">Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">The world is shifting to the digital-era with a fast rate, i.e., everything/everyone is
            moving towards digitalization like various entertainment and business sources, recent trends, announcement
            of new products, and so on, and this change will change even more than this current growth rate. In
            digitalization, users/consumers get satisfied with an instant response from the service provider. There are
            many useful conveniences and benefits of digital era, including several negatives. For example, one popular
            negative concern/destructive threat is that it keeps/poses our private (personal) information at risk now.
            In the previous decade, we have encountered/mitigated hundreds of cases related to theft of identity, data
            leakage, and money loss. In general, cyberattacks are inescapable and do affect individuals, corporations,
            and government bodies. Currently, the world has virtually reached a stage where cybercriminals can easily
            carry out their targets using smart things (including their intelligence) properly. Hence, today the need
            for cybersecurity has never been more critical and dangerous than before.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">AI is an extraordinary component of information technology that involves the emergence of a
            computer that behaves and operates like a human mind. <a id="page69" />The main aspects of AI include the
            analogy of human senses. The machine is capable of understanding touch and voice as attributes that are put
            within the system without the aid of humans to operate the possible tasks of the regular life situation. AI,
            however, is the analysis of intelligence agents that involves the state of the world and successfully
            attains its target. The plurality of structures in the computer environment is designed to fulfil the
            purposes according to the essence of the case with the application of the special characteristics from the
            natural current features of the person. <em><a href="#fig4_1">Figure 4.1</a></em> explains the evolution of
            ML-based learning techniques:</p>

        <p class="figcap" id="fig4_1"><strong>Figure 4.1:</strong> Evolution of machine learning techniques</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Now having massive potentials of AI, attackers may use AI for their purpose/use, to
            automate/ perform cyber-attacks on a large scale. Till today attackers/adversaries were relying on human
            resources to craft and co-ordinate their attacks. On the other hand, we (experts) can use AI and
            <strong>Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>) to take over human-based work force to identify
            (detect) cyber-attacks (or cyber-crime) instantly (or in early stages), that is, in a shorter period of
            time, it saves huge cost for cyber-security-based applications. Note that attackers/adversaries can also use
            AI for the same (for cyber-crimes). Further enhancement in AI can lead to numerous cyber threats. AI is
            powerful enough to hack into systems much quicker than humans. Currently, three main implications of AI are
            of threat which mainly includes a combination of todays’ attacks, i.e., the creation of novel threats and
            the variations in persisting threats. Some popular reasons of using AI for cyber security/fighting against
            cybercrime are as follows:

        <ul class="bull">
            <li><a id="page70" /><strong>Increasing vulnerabilities</strong>
                <p class="nonindent">Today’s smart things (or <strong>Internet of Things</strong>
                    (<strong>IoTs</strong>)) have many applications; for example, agriculture, manufacturing, vehicles,
                    control systems, and so on. Seven industries, including consumer products, retail, banking,
                    insurance, automotive, utilities, and telecom (refer to <em><a href="#fig4_1">Figure 4.1</a></em>)
                    are using IoT devices:</p>
                <figure class="img">
                    <img alt="" src="Internet of Things Theory and Practice/images/Figure-4.2.jpg" />
                </figure>
                <p class="figcap" id="fig4_2"><strong>Figure 4.2:</strong> Integration of Artificial Intelligence with
                    other applications</p>
                <p class="nonindent">In <em><a href="#fig4_2">Figure 4.2</a></em>, we see that IoT devices will be used
                    in most of the possible applications for making lives of humans easier to live and convenient. In
                    the near future, IoTs will receive a greater number of cyber-threats, discussed by <em>Tyagi et
                        al</em>. (2020). Generally, Internet of Things consists of four layers in architecture, i.e.,
                    physical, perception, network, and physical. Many security issues (mitigated in the previous decade)
                    in each layer are listed in <em><a href="#tab4_1">Table 4.1</a></em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Increasing loss</strong>
                <p class="nonindent">Due to having more cyber-attacks on business, many industries are losing
                    information and also huge money/revenue to protect their business/systems/infrastructure against
                    such critical attacks. Even, in the year 2018, industries had invested more than $2,472 million for
                    protection efforts against cyber-attacks. In 2017 alone, this protection efforts cost for many
                    businesses was $86.4 billion.</p>
            </li>
            <li><a id="page71" /><strong>Leaking of personal information (identity and data privacy)</strong>
                <p class="nonindent">Today’s bank and many other organizations (related to finance) are selling
                    customers’ data to insurance companies to attract more customers to improve their business. It is a
                    complete violation of leaking user’s personal information to other party users (without getting the
                    owner’s permission/concern). Big Data has been supporting numerous sectors/organizations in
                    acquiring goals which include increased customer acquisitions, increasing customer shares, market
                    shares, and so on. Big Data is used to create a sustainable (affordable, easily accessible)
                    environment. Also, adversaries also steal user’s information from many businesses and sell it to
                    opposite competitors to blackmail respective users (or use this stolen information for their
                    financial gains/ blackmail). It is completely violation of privacy, so privacy issues have been
                    raised as essential and critical issues in the previous decade. Many researchers/research
                    communities have tried to provide several innovative solutions to protect the user’s privacy against
                    such cyber-attacks (criminal). Note that concerns regarding privacy over other public concerns (in
                    various sectors) have emerged in the last few years, i.e., every user available on the web cares for
                    his/her privacy, not interested in losing his/her private information. Today’s tech industry’s focus
                    has shifted on usability, rather than expense of security.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Weaker security</strong>
                <p class="nonindent">As discussed earlier, privacy is more essential and primary concern of
                    users/business industries. Today’s accessing private credentials of users are hackers’ most popular
                    interest, i.e., a fissure to extract valuable data from organizations/corporations for lucrative
                    sales on the Dark Web. It is an example of using too bad (weaker) security in protecting a critical
                    business/infrastructure.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>High complexity and low efficiency</strong>
                <p class="nonindent">Today, detecting cyber-attacks by human work force or manually is too complex and
                    may take many days sometimes. Every day, we (i.e., businesses/industries) are facing many
                    cyber-attacks, through which many industries lose millions of rupees every day. Even sometimes, due
                    to such/these attacks, businesses may get affected or the efficiency of industries gets affected.

        <h1 class="sec1" id="s86"><a href="toc.xhtml#s86a">Problems/risks in the current scenario</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">As discussed earlier, IoT0073 are currently in use in many applications/sectors to reduce
            the workload and increase the efficiency of many businesses/industries. But as the first risk, these smart
            devices are also facing several open challenges/issues. We need to protect IoT and <strong>Industrial
                Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IIoT</strong>) sensors and systems against any
            cyber-attacks/tempering. Adversarial AI has been introduced as risk to human based-based cyber security; it
            refers to the development and use of AI for malicious purposes/spreading malicious. Cyber attackers or
            criminals can use AI to improve their attempts/cyber-attacks (working as an enemy). Adversarial AI means a
            user/hacker can use AI for his/her use in performing an attack. Also, monitoring each ‘<em>packet’</em> of
            data, i.e., each part of networks communications is almost impossible for human analysts to monitor or
            track/verify accurately. Human experts might take several days to weeks to fully understand these policies
            and make sure the security implementation is successful.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">We need to recognize the possible risks associated with adversarial AI or reduce the
            workload of human experts. Some examples of adversarial AI are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li>Chatbots, etc.</li>
            <li>Consider cases wherein a cybercriminal produces an adversarial image which overcomes facial recognition
                software. For example, an iPhone X’s ‘<em>FaceID</em>’ access characteristics makes use of neural
                networks to identify and spot faces, which makes it prone to contradictory AI attacks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent">AI has the ability to respond very quickly to cyber-attacks which would take significant
            amount of time (based on the scenario) to recognize humans. With such speed, <a id="page73" />we need to
            avoid such unauthorized access (attempts) in digitally-based business models, and require a password-less
            world, which will be more dependable on AI (machines). AI should develop an efficient approach which raises
            privacy alarms in case of leaking any user’s/customer’s privacy. Note that more dependability on AI may also
            a cause for revealing the user’s privacy to other machines or users.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Today’s cyber security requires more basic needs than before. Preserving the
            privacy/identity is a primary concern in the twenty-first century; also the new security perimeter which
            requires a Zero Trust Security framework to be secure against serious criminal/cyber threats/attacks. In the
            near future, we can detect cyber threats using AI and predict threats on a network, that is, threat hunting,
            also can respond accordingly. In other words, AI takes advantages against fraudsters and hackers. For
            example, PetSmart (a US-based specialty retailer), was able to save up to $12M by using AI in fraud
            detection from Kountet al. AI is helping under-resourced security operations analysts stay ahead of threats.
            We need to identify, recognize, and react to threats spontaneously, i.e., solutions to the digital security
            need to be profound and highly responsive. Like investment banks use predictive data models to forecast
            markets, insurance companies to predict accidents, or retailers to figure out the optimal time to send us a
            special offer; soon user authentication would rely on similar data analytics to protect users against
            serious threats.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Several popular tools/security tools like Maltego, OWASP <strong>Zed Attack Proxy</strong>
            (<strong>ZAP</strong>), Snort, Wireshark, and AI, etc. can help us in detection, prediction, and providing
            response. <strong>Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>)-based software frameworks potentially make
            use of numerous techniques which include statistical analysis, keyword cross-checking, ambiguity spotting,
            and so on to check whether a particular data packet varies from the baseline of training data sets. Areas
            where AI adds values in cybersecurity for detecting cyber-attacks are large-scale data analysis and anomaly
            detection. AI needs to build such that it should be able to monitor every event on the public network and
            respond to their respective user about the occurrence of an incident. Also, for a strong security or secure
            environment, we can use <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication</strong> (<strong>MFA</strong>) wherever
            possible on a network.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s87"><a href="toc.xhtml#s87a">Benefits of using Artificial Intelligence in the twenty-first
                century</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">We know that as digital businesses grow, their risk of cyber-attacks exponentially
            increases in the respective businesses. Detecting breach attempts today without the use of AI technologies
            is time consuming and a costly process. AI is used to help identify threats and thwart attacks. Note that
            cybersecurity inherently involves repetitiveness and tediousness. It reduces the workload of engineers, and
            it is the necessity of the future. The following are the listed benefits of AI:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li><a id="page74" />To handle voluminous security data</li>
            <li>Picking out threat needles in cyber haystacks</li>
            <li>To increase detection and response times</li>
            <li>To held the head high for AI in the arms race</li>
            <li>Breathing space for human cyber security teams</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent">Hence, AI can be trained and used more as a savior for many businesses rather than as enemy
            for the same.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s88"><a href="toc.xhtml#s88a">Open discussion: Required changes in the near future with
                respect to cyber security</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Today, one of the most vulnerable and fastest-growing threat surfaces is mobile phones.
            Data is at the core of cyber security trends and at risk. Threats which revolve around our workplace would
            result in exposing the entire establishment to vulnerabilities at frequent intervals which would ultimately
            lead to data breaches. We need to provide the “<em>trust but verify</em>” approach, low complexity, and high
            benefits; it reduces the time in identifying fraud or attack detection. Artificial Intelligence in cyber
            security is beneficial because it improves “<em>how security experts analyse, study, and understands
                cybercrime.</em>” In the coming days, identifying fraudulent activities, malware and intrusion
            detection, scoring risk in a network, and so on are few of the highly used AI test cases for enhancing
            cybersecurity. Using AI in businesses or by industries will increase the trust or bond with consumers.
            Consumers can rely and trust more on their business partners. It advances cyber security methods which are
            implemented in companies to overthrow cybercriminals and ensures the safety of the organizations and
            customers.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">As days pass by, AI has been proving itself to be an arena of throbbing interest and
            extensive investments within the cyber safety society. It potentially monitors the suspicious pattern in the
            ordinary data classifying it as cyber-threats (like phishing, and so on.). In summary, artificial
            intelligence cyber security measures improve the digital security and help in digital forensics and threat
            hunting (also threat anticipation, incident response) process.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">AI is penetrating deep in cyber security, but what about the human interface and reaction
            for solving the problem. Are we in a stage where computers can take human decisions? In our views, it is a
            better way to analyse data by ourself than to do by computers, i.e., removing the probability of revealing
            the user’s information or protecting systems against security breaches that can think and do in nanoseconds
            tasks (working as a savior). Also, we can start using blockchain-based solutions to avoid security-breaches
            or any attacks on a network. It needs to be pointed out <a id="page75" />that the security products which
            are developed on the AI framework are not less expensive and this indeed, puts forward a dilemma for
            majority of the small-scale businesses currently. However, a rapid response to this issue would never be to
            hire a large supporting team to develop custom cybersecurity systems as a solution to this problem. In
            summary, we require more trained people, that is, data science professionals or data engineers and cyber
            security professionals in the near future to fulfil and detect cyber-crimes in early stages. At the end, we
            suggest our readers to go through articles to know more about IoT roles in many critical applications and
            integration with various emerging technologies like cloud computing, blockchain, and so on, for many useful
            applications in detail.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s89"><a href="toc.xhtml#s89a">Future suggestions</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Context-based, risk-based, and implicit authentications are the essential elements of a
            secured business/infrastructure. We require tighter and stronger security (using hash and digital signature
            mechanisms, and so on.) for our infrastructure against popular worms, viruses (like Stuxnet), and so on,
            attacks on respective systems/infrastructures. We have discussed several advances in artificial intelligence
            security tools (in the near future) and “<em>how the technology impacts organizations, cybercriminals, and
                consumers alike.</em>” Few ways where AI and ML can make a huge difference towards cybersecurity are as
            follows:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li>AI, password protection, and authentication.</li>
            <li>AI-ML in phishing detection and prevention control.</li>
            <li>Usage of <strong>Artificial Intelligence-Machine Learning</strong> (<strong>AI-ML</strong>) in
                vulnerability management.</li>
            <li>Network Security and Artificial Intelligence.</li>
            <li>Cloud-based <strong>Single-Sign-On</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>) or dual authentication methods are
                gaining wider adoption by many applications by doing verification via SMS or software-based security.
                Today Dual authentication feature (in many applications) is on higher priority SSO is somewhere in the
                middle.</li>
            <li>In frictionless authentication concepts like zero log-in and implicit authentication, where a system or
                device can use sensors and machine learning algorithms to simply recognise us by our behaviors. So, the
                requirement of a password-less world is the next step in computing the environment (using AI).
                Accessibility of things will be provided via fast biometric recognition (low friction identity
                management) using AI.</li>
            <li>AI uses blockchain for providing secure infrastructure or attack-free infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent"><a id="page76" />Note that when we integrated AI into our cyber security solutions, our
            cyber security analysts and other IT security employees need to know “<em>how to effectively use it.</em>”
            Cost, resources, and training are some components of artificial intelligence-based cyber security protection
            software. In the near future, we need an equal balance of convenience/balance among security and privacy
            components in an infrastructure (or business).</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s90"><a href="toc.xhtml#s90a">Future work</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Note that with implementation of AI everywhere (in possible applications, to reduce
            workload of human experts), we will face several negative views/aspects also, i.e., of AI in cyber security,
            like revealing our privacy or having our entire information which is a higher risk. But still, we need to
            shift towards AI in cyber security (using AI as a savior). A human being cannot process large amount of data
            (simply) at the required speed, i.e., to keep our network and data safe. But AI can do it more efficiently,
            i.e., can do it without needing to sleep, eat, or take a vacation. Moreover, we can look at several possible
            uses of AI in areas like:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li>AI for cloud/fog computing:
                <ul class="bull">
                    <li>In various agriculture-related activities</li>
                    <li>In transportation-related simulation</li>
                    <li>In defence area</li>
                    <li>In numerous automated applications</li>
                    <li>In several banking-related tasks</li>
                    <li>Multimedia applications, for example, audio, video</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AI for software development: Software development for applications like:
                <ul class="bull">
                    <li>In various agriculture-related activities</li>
                    <li>In transportation-related simulation</li>

            <li>AI for Industry 4.0</li>
            <li>AI for data science and blockchain (including for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0)
                <ul class="bull">
                    <li><a id="page77" />Machine learning-based blockchain solution</li>
                    <li>Combination of IoT and blockchain</li>
                    <li>Combination of AI, cloud/edge computing with blockchain</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Machine intelligence (computer vision) in medical imaging
                <ul class="bull">
                    <li>Penetration testing using AI and ML</li>
                    <li>ML in chemical sciences</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>AI and IoTs for other sectors:
                <ul class="bull">
                    <li>IoT in higher education systems
                        <ul class="bull">
                            <li>Impact of IoT is education now and in future</li>
                            <li>A learning management system enhanced with Internet of Things</li>
                        </ul>

                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent">Hence, we can say that AI is the most essential technology today and in the next decade, it
            will overtake maximum applications/sectors which are dependent on IoTs devices. Many Industries will shift
            towards the use of AI will prefer to implement AI for increasing productivity and profit of their business.
            AI will make people’s life convenient and longer to live via helping/doing everyday tasks for them. Note
            that in this COVID 19 pandemic, AI was used by many sectors like airport, government, and so on, for thermal
            screening/for identifying a COVID positive person. AI is also helping society/ people via providing
            touchless/contactless services. In summary, AI will be the most productive with the blockchain technology
            because AI will reduce the possibility of errors in businesses and blockchain will provide tight-security to
            that business (or sectors) through its distributed ledger technology concept.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">The reader should refer <em>P P Ray</em>, <em>Reyna et al</em>., and <em>Tyagi et al</em>.,
            works to know more about IoTs and its working with other computing environments like AI, cloud computing,
            edge commuting, and digital twin technology, and so on.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s91"><a href="toc.xhtml#s91a">Conclusion</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">AI has been used with the duty of easing out the workload from the shoulders of skilled
            engineers in this field (useful for IoT-based Cloud Applications) and to deal with these issues in the right
            and accurate way. Also, training many people for implementing AI in the near future is a challenging task
            and time consuming (lengthy) process. Enhancing techniques in ML refers to the AI implementations which can
            autonomously acclimatize to changes and identify problems quickly. In the near future, there are interesting
            scopes of several enhancements with AI which are included as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li><a id="page78" />Artificial Intelligence (AI) for cyber security</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) to monitor email/ spam mails</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for developing antivirus software</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for analyzing user behaviors</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for fighting against AI based threats</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for defence sector</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for software development</li>
            <li>Artificial Intelligence (AI) for other relevant sectors like agriculture, nuclear energy, healthcare,
                transportation, weather prediction, stock market prediction, natural language processing, and so on.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent">Hence, the near future/ future applications belong to smart era that is smart things and
            Artificial intelligence. We will see the use of Smart things/ IoT and AI almost in every useful application.
            In the end, we are eagerly waiting for a touchless/contactless and decentralized world (like decentralized
            economy, decentralized Internet, other decentralized services) where each person/human can live their life
            easily without any hassles.</p>
