    <h1>Manufacturing Processes: Theoretical Background</h1>

    <p><strong>Manufacturing processes</strong> are systematic methods employed to transform raw materials into finished
        products. These processes involve a series of steps, techniques, and technologies aimed at achieving efficient
        production while ensuring product quality, consistency, and cost-effectiveness.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Material Selection:</strong>
            <p>The choice of materials is a critical decision in manufacturing processes. Engineers consider factors
                such as material properties, cost, and intended applications when selecting the most suitable raw
                materials for a given product.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Casting:</strong>
            <p>Casting is a common manufacturing process that involves pouring molten material into a mold to create a
                desired shape. It is used for a variety of materials, including metals, plastics, and ceramics.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Machining:</strong>
            <p>Machining processes, such as milling, turning, and grinding, involve the removal of material to achieve
                the desired shape and dimensions. Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining has revolutionized
                precision manufacturing.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Forming:</strong>
            <p>Forming processes include techniques like forging, stamping, and rolling, which deform materials to
                achieve specific shapes. These processes are often used for metals and polymers.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Joining:</strong>
            <p>Joining processes involve combining multiple parts to create a unified product. Common joining methods
                include welding, brazing, soldering, and adhesive bonding.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Additive Manufacturing:</strong>
            <p>Also known as 3D printing, additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer from digital models. It
                has gained prominence for its ability to create complex geometries with reduced material waste.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Heat Treatment:</strong>
            <p>Heat treatment processes alter the physical and mechanical properties of materials. Annealing, quenching,
                and tempering are common heat treatment methods used to enhance hardness, toughness, and other
                characteristics.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong>
            <p>Ensuring product quality is integral to manufacturing processes. Quality control methods involve
                inspections, measurements, and testing to identify and rectify defects, ensuring that products meet
                specified standards.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Automation and Robotics:</strong>
            <p>Modern manufacturing often incorporates automation and robotics to enhance efficiency and precision.
                Automated systems can perform tasks like assembly, inspection, and material handling.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong>
            <p>Sustainable manufacturing focuses on minimizing environmental impact by optimizing resource use, reducing
                waste, and adopting eco-friendly practices in manufacturing processes.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In conclusion, manufacturing processes play a pivotal role in producing a wide range of goods. Advances in
        technology and continuous improvement methodologies contribute to the evolution of efficient, sustainable, and
        innovative manufacturing practices across various industries.</p>
