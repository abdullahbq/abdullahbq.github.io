        <p class="nonindent">Rapidly evolving cores of information, technology, and societal perspectives have been
            bringing about drastic changes to the community. It often seems as though the world is heading forward
            towards a digitalized world where new concepts and revolutionary ideas would rule the decisions being made
            and the lifestyles being adapted. Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 are undoubtedly the major revolutionary ideas
            that pave way to complement the digital environment in a multifaceted way. Industry 4.0 promises to and
            focuses on bringing about novel changes with respect to the production and manufacturing in the industrial
            sector. It aims towards achieving real-time production, planning and execution, and dynamic functionality
            implementation. Society 5.0 caters to devoting its focus on the techniques and strategies which would uplift
            the human society through smart and intelligent ways. In simpler terms, it can be observed that Society 5.0
            facilitates a human-centered approach for development and growth. Another link that bridges these two
            concepts is that Society 5.0 is often known to utilize the intelligent systems procured by Industry 4.0 for
            complementing the benefits generated. With the adaptation of such grave concepts, digitalization surely
            comes into play. In fact a digital environment is what provides a foreground for the flourishment of these
            life changing concepts. This chapter talks in depth about the concepts of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 and
            how they provide a digital environment.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s51"><a id="page40" /><a href="toc.xhtml#s51a">Structure</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">In this chapter, we will discuss the following topics:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li>Introduction to Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</li>
            <li>Trends in Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</li>

        </ul>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s52"><a href="toc.xhtml#s52a">Objectives</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">In this digital environment, society and industries are also being modernized. For example,
            Japan has its particular challenges and just as Industry 4.0 is the digital transformation of manufacturing,
            whereas Society 5.0 aims to tackle several challenges by going far beyond just the digitalization of the
            economy towards the digitalization across all levels of the Japanese society and the digital transformation
            of society itself. Hence, this chapter presents few interesting concepts of Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 in
            a digital environment in detail.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s53"><a href="toc.xhtml#s53a">Introduction to Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Industry 4.0 has been one of the newest phases with advanced strategical approaches in the
            industrial revolution. The concepts under the umbrella of Industry 4.0 mainly lay weight on interaction,
            intercommunication, <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> (<strong>AI</strong>) and <strong>Machine
                Learning</strong> (<strong>ML</strong>), and so on. However, Industry 4.0 is not just a breakthrough
            where a new technology was being implemented to a great extend with regards to bringing about improvements
            and enhancements in the manufacturing field. The main aim of Industry 4.0 is to emerge with ground breaking
            and revolutionary ideas and strategies which would, in turn, take the holistic business approach forward. In
            fact, it’s often considered as a very organized and structured revolution to bring about these aesthetic
            changes in the functioning of the industrial platforms. For majority of the problems and issues faced by the
            industrial facilitation, Industry 4.0 has always tried to bring in an autonomous and optimized solutional
            implementation. Some of the main parameters which are touched upon by the developers of the solution during
            this revolution include: curating solution sector wise, providing customer centric experiences, and the
            option of reducing the generated volume of manufactured products, taking flexibility to the next level, and
            leading a sustainable platform.</p>
        <p class="nonindent"><a id="page41" />One of the other such revolutionary concepts is Society 5.0 which takes
            its grass roots from the Japanese government. Its main focus was to form a societal concept which is a
            strong bridged community of cyber and physical space so as to strike a balance in the economic development
            using the required goods and latent. In simpler words, this societal advancement focuses on revamping the
            existential relations between the society and technology and that of relations which endow technologically
            facilitated relations between the community. Society 5.0 has a hierarchical path which leads down to Society
            1.0 (hunting society), Society 2.0 (agricultural society), Society 3.0 (industrial society), Society 4.0
            (information society) and Society 5.0 (smart society). The proposal for this concept was initiated in the
            fifth Science and Technology Basic Plan as an idea for the futuristic society that Japan should aspire to
            become in the coming years. By closely observing the intricate issues and problems faced by the community in
            the current society, the reforms for Society 5.0 were carefully laid out. Achieving a society with a forward
            mind set and futuristic thinking which highlights mutual respect for the individuals of the society and the
            provide freedom and an enthusiastic life. <em><a href="#fig2_1">Figure 2.1</a></em> portrays the evolution
            of our industry over the different phases (1.0 to 4.0) and stages:</p>
        <figure class="img">

        <p class="figcap" id="fig2_1"><strong>Figure 2.1:</strong> Industrial Evolution from Industry 1.0 to Industry
            4.0</p>
        <p class="nonindent">One of the major proposals put forth and adopted by the Japanese Cabinet during the fifth
            Science and Technology basic plan was Society 5.0 – a human centered approach towards enhancing and
            optimizing the community. Ultimately, this concept churned out to be an integral strategy for Japan’s
            growth. Looking down the memory lane, the human society has evolved through different stages and phases in
            life. The very first society can be visualized as a community of people indulging in hunting and related
            activities for coexistence and survival. The next evolved society was dependent on agriculture and farming
            for their survival following which the third societal evolution catered to organizational developments and
            industrialization. The fourth phase of society was often called the informational society which was heavily
            dependent on networking and informational aspects. In Society 5.0, the Japanese government wants to build up
            on the foundational Society 4.0 with the motive of <a id="page42" />curating a human-centric environment.
            However, one of the major points to be noted here is that though Society 5.0 is a potential technique for
            Japan’s flourishment, it is not restricted to this approach alone and it also caters to the adoption of
            tasks as that of <strong>Sustainable Development Goals</strong> (<strong>SDGs</strong>). Developing from the
            very basics of a society with the aim of surviving and coexisting, to an agricultural society, followed by
            an industrial and informational society and ultimately heading towards one of the super smart societies.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">On taking a closer look at the industrial transformation in the respective sector across
            years, it can be inferred that there have been significant changes which have uplifted the businesses and
            those indulged in these sectors to great heights. This concept is slightly complex and focuses on the
            internal tech architectural framework of the systems and the scheme of organizations in various industrial
            domains and genres. One of the commonly adapted approaches for efficiently adapting to these changes is to
            identify and introspect and conduct exploratory analysis with respect to the industrial field. Following
            which, the framework is used to analyze the major components of this concept – smart products, smart supply
            chains, smart work, and smart manufacturing. Various analysis and visualization techniques can be used to
            analyze the respective sector further and to choose the suitable measures. <em><a href="#fig2_2">Figure
                    2.2</a></em> can be used for illustrating how an ordinary and conventional society can be
            transformed to a well aware and smart society for the very fifth phase of revolution. There are many
            components which affect and improvise the society by inhibiting a variety of solutions to the common life
            problems and incorporating convenient techniques.</p>

            along with Big Data are some of the emerging technologies which are sure shot strategies for enhancement and
            improvisations. Any of the security-related problems can be easily curbed by blockchain and distributed
            ledger techniques. So, this revolutionary concept aims to provide a holistic development approach. The
            reader should refer to <em>P P Ray</em>, <em>Reyna et al</em>., and <em>Tyagi et al</em>., and work to know
            more about IoTs and its working with other computing environments.</p>

        <h1 class="sec1" id="s54"><a href="toc.xhtml#s54a">Scope of IoT in Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 are true trendsetters within their own dimensional domains.
            From a plethora of aspects these concepts have evolved holistically leading to healthy, innovative and smart
            trends being propagated. When it comes to Industry 4.0, one of the highly observable trends is the
            utilization of intelligent entities to inculcate features of adaptability, efficiency, and integrity. In
            fact, majority of the applications which are considered to be ‘Smart’ are an extension of the trends set in
            by Industry 4.0, including those of smart manufacturing, smart products, smart cities, and so on.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Applications like smart factories and industries work with extensive interfaces and
            platforms which facilitate command execution, transfer of data, and interaction and cohesiveness among the
            individual nodes and devices in the system. Industry 4.0 manages to scale up the applications (all
            applications from agriculture to weather) to a top-notch level by contributing with respect to the number of
            nascent and novel ideas, strategies, and techniques that can enhance the optimal results obtained by the
            systems like <strong>Industrial Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IIoT</strong>) cloud-based approaches,
            etc. One of the other major trends which has been impacted by Industry 4.0 is a wave of competition to all
            other companies in the industry as they struggle to overcome the curbs and challenges of their business with
            respect to cost, worthiness, and what not. Industry 4.0 is more of like an innovation checker which keeps
            all the other competitors up to date by indirectly forcing them to upgrade their working standards and paths
            of strategic planning for innovative and striking ideas which can help them withstand their relevancy in the
            market.</p>
        <p class="nonindent"><a id="page44" />When it comes to Society 5.0, the fact is that it focuses on a more human
            centric and focused development through an all-inclusive dimension. With the main aim of enhancing and
            improvising the quality of life using enhanced and optimized technologies, the ideologies of Society 5.0 is
            itself a trend. This tender concept is coined with respect to parallel intelligence wherein <strong>Cyber
                Physical Systems</strong> (<strong>CPS</strong>) is integrated along with concepts of AI and ML.
            Parallel intelligence is one of the latest and best techniques to efficiently handle the complex and
            sophisticated issues that are commonly encountered during community or societal development. The trend of
            parallel intelligence is fast growing and has gained the spotlight in a number of different domains. The
            fact that Society 5.0 is the upcoming smart society with the foundation on Society 4.0 is a trend which
            spreads the hope of an evolutionary prosperous and human-centric society.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">One of the major common grounds for Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 is that both of these
            concepts involve an extensive utilization of knowledge as well as intelligence. However, there exists a thin
            line which differentiates the two with regards to these concepts. Industry 4.0 involves generation of
            knowledge as well as intelligence along-side human interaction using advanced strategies; on the contrary,
            in Society 5.0, the generation of knowledge and intelligence are to be taken care of by advanced devices and
            systems to cater to the needs and requirements of the people. The fact that both Industry 4.0 and Society
            5.0 indulge in the essence of automation, intelligence, and learning is what binds them together. Parameters
            like digital society, sustainability, automation, healthy lifestyle, safety and security, and advanced
            technologies in different domains of life are some of the major parameters which prove to be the pillars in
            these two revolutionary concepts. In fact, the current era is being fuelled by the energy of using smart
            strategies consisting of IoT, AI, ML, robotics, automation, distributed ledger techniques, and so on.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">The idea behind the initiative of such implementations has been to introduce the innovation
            strategy so as to increase the core growth of the society. With regards to societal transformation, while it
            has affected the lifestyle convenience of the society members, it surely has sparked the complexities and
            sophistications of how a super smart society would transform. <em>Mayumi Fukuyama</em>, the General Manager
            and CIO Technology Management Centre, Technology Strategy Office, Research &amp; Development Group, Hitachi,
            Ltd. has said that achieving a super smart society is a combined effort and digitalization plays a major
            role by providing a platform as a means to achieve the innovation-driven goal. She considers Society 5.0 as
            one of those emerging spaces which is integrated with cyberspace technology which involves a number of
            initiatives and propagational ideas which aims towards achieving a smart and intellectual community.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s55"><a id="page45" /><a href="toc.xhtml#s55a">Industry 4.0 versus Society 5.0</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Though there are quite a few similarities in the aims, goals, and visions with regards to
            Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0, the differences make each of these concepts uniquely distinct and draw a fine
            line between them. Industry 4.0 is more often considered as a network and graph which interlinks the various
            applicable machine systems, automated devices, and entities in the field of industrial management. This is
            to ensure a stronger sense of interaction and communication among the participants in the development phase
            of any industrial commitment. The three major paradigms which govern the existence of this industrial
            revolution are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="bull">
            <li><strong>Intelligence of products</strong>: This assures that the operational and logistical data related
                to the products are stored within them and follows a standardized procedure so that they can coordinate
                and interact between the different resources required during production.</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligence of machines</strong>: This is an essential component and paradigm as the machines
                and devices used for the infrastructural development of the industries are to be made enhanced so as to
                replace the traditional production flow with a more decentralized and flexible production line.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration of CPS</strong>: CPS is one of the other evolving factors which contributes
                significantly to the growth and improvement of the implementational factor of Industry 4.0.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="nonindent">A lot of improvisational elements in the industrial sector have been powered by the concept
            of Industry 4.0. One such example is that of smart factories wherein efficiency of resources,
            acclimatization, and smartness of entities are focused on to get enhanced production results. Further, the
            concept of this industrial revolution spreads a healthy competitive vibe among all other competitors in the
            market which constantly pushes the business makers to perform at their best.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">On the other hand, Society 5.0 is more about centering humans in the evolutionary process
            for heading towards a healthier and prosperous life for benefitting the human society. It is often said that
            Industry 4.0 is considered to be the driving fuel for Society 5.0 and Japan has already begun its
            exploration amidst this revolution. Parallel intelligence is the key concept, or rather, the heart and soul
            of Society 5.0. Parallel intelligence is considered as an extension to artificial intelligence except that
            it is highly integrated and linked to cyber physical systems. The ultimate aim and goal of Society 5.0 is
            not only to just mechanize and automate each and every domain but also ensure sustainability in the
            lifestyle and development by achieving a super smart society.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s56"><a id="page46" /><a href="toc.xhtml#s56a">History of previous industrial and society
                revolutions</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">It started with the very first industrial revolution Industry 1.0 in the late 18th century.
            This revolution is what sparked up the urge for introducing the world to mechanical production techniques to
            perpetuate the mass production of goods with ease. It mainly focused on the quality, efficiency, and scale
            of the techniques and strategies involved and significant changes could be observed as small factories and
            stores were evolving into large organizations, serving a large number of audiences. The next revolutionary
            step in the industrial revolution was Industry 2.0 which commenced in the beginning of the twentieth
            century. When the previous revolution focused on bringing in mechanical concepts to production, Industry 2.0
            specifically aimed towards bringing in electric power to facilitate the machines and devices. These devices
            and systems were indeed a turning point for the industrialists as it was much easier and less cumbersome to
            operate on these machines with enhanced results and optimum efficiency. Another significant change that came
            about during this era was the introduction to efficient management systems and frameworks. A variety of
            production management strategies were adopted which ultimately led to enhanced quality results. Following
            this revolution came Industry 3.0 which commenced in the later stages of the twentieth century where there
            was a surge in the inventions and innovations brought about with respect to electronic devices using
            transistors and integrated circuits.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">One of the significant achievements in this revolutionary stage was to automate the
            strategies and techniques being used leading to massive speed, more accuracy, and reducing human
            interference to the maximum. A notable observation was also faced with regards to the software and not just
            the hardware applications. Software applications were now capable of not just controlling the hardware
            components but were put to use for resource planning, inventory management, and so on. In other words, this
            was also the revolutionary point where the tech industry/IT field took birth. Finally, the fourth industrial
            revolution is what brought about massive changes across the globe, connecting people from all over the world
            through networking, telecommunication, and a plethora of other advanced technologies. The incorporation of
            CPS has further aggravated the strategy to communicate efficiently with various devices and nodes
            efficiently and robustly.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Many research and analogies have reciprocated that the very first model of society, Society
            1.0 was the hunting community. This society mainly aimed towards coexisting with nature so as to lead a life
            by taking the benefits reaped from hunting. Following this model of society came Society 2.0 which was the
            Agrarian society. This society <a id="page47" />commenced towards the end of the 18th century and focused on
            achieving various agricultural improvements while reaping benefits that they acquired by sowing seeds. This
            form of a society has been a rock-solid framework which is followed to a great extent in many countries
            across the world for a living. Then, came Society 3.0 which intersected with the industrial revolution
            wherein more focus was given to locomotives and mass production. This form of society was also one of the
            rooted societies which has been a turning point as it focused on easing out the tedious production
            strategies. Society 4.0 resonates with the information society wherein the goal was to ultimately achieve
            the digital transformation and add a new dimension to the common lifestyle. Various computers and gadgets
            were introduced which could keep the society well connected and informed of the happening around the world
            and since then, there hasn’t been a turn back. Society 5.0 is an extended version of the above-mentioned
            societies which aims to improvise on each of the mentioned fields leading to a sustainable and smart
            society.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s57"><a href="toc.xhtml#s57a">Digital environment</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">Few of the radical changes and modifications brought in by the above mention concepts of
            industrial and societal revolutions have shaped the community to a great extent. One of the major changes
            which has significantly been on the rising scale over the years has been digitalization. In fact, the
            virtual and digital world has been a trend which the society and evolved community has been solely dependent
            on knowingly or unknowingly. Especially with the outbreak of the deadly corona virus, lifestyles of humans
            have changed to a great extent, where each and every being was exposed to the digital and virtual side of
            the world. Be it the medical, education, industrial, finance, or business sector, the process flow and
            framework which act as the foundation for the existence of these services have been influenced and enhanced
            to novel developments. Another stream in which digitalization has surely invested on is the field of
            sustainable development.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">The digital environment is an abstract environment which facilitates communication wherein
            the services offered and activities that proliferate happen on a digitalized platform. With advancing
            technological developments and solutions, a plethora of domains and sectors in the society, be it
            professional or personal, are benefitting and heading forward with a healthy competitive attitude. In other
            words, digitalization has paved way for improvising and polishing the processes and conventional methods
            through digital footprints. A digital environment would focus on increasing and upscaling possibilities of
            productivity and efficiency while keeping in mind the budget-related concerns and factors. However, it
            doesn’t truly aim at eliminating human interference from the loop but rather focuses on providing a platform
            and sustainable environment for humans to grow and flourish by using the digitalized aids as a tool.</p>

            technological concepts, and features which complement the existence of a digitalized environment. Starting
            from the applications of drones and sensors for navigational and data-driven purposes, to computing
            techniques, including those of edge, cloud, and fog computing, to exploiting AI, ML, and DL for their
            benefits, using <strong>Internet of Things</strong> (<strong>IoT</strong>) for intelligent concept
            implementation, all the way to using blockchain for privacy and security preservation to making use of
            augmented and virtual reality for enhanced applications; digital environment covers it all.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s58"><a href="toc.xhtml#s58a">Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 in a digital environment</a>
        </h1>
        <p class="nonindent">The futuristic version of evolving societies and industrial sectors surely has a large
            scope for a completely digitalized platform which would complement the findings and features of Society 5.0
            and Industry 4.0 to great levels. In fact, surveys and researches have proven that the current lifestyle
            followed across the globe in majority of places is itself fostered by networks of <strong>Information
                Technology</strong> (<strong>IT</strong>), such that there’s no factor of hesitant involved in
            predicting how digitalized the world would be a few years down the lane. Objects and domains surrounding us
            are getting smarter and intelligent by the hour through intricate technologies which uplift digitalization
            <a id="page49" />for an improved lifestyle. In fact, it seems like the community is racing towards a living
            where there would be a huge transition with regards to the incorporation of digitalized technologies and
            strategies along with CPS. The definition of Society 5.0 seems to resonate with the core concept of how
            digitalization would cater to a human-centric community which looks forward to a sustainable living so as to
            preserve the resources for the future and to develop holistically. Considering the case of Industry 4.0
            where automation is one of the key players, digitalization truly has a solid ground in displaying and
            showcasing its efficiencies and benefices. The common generalized perspective of identifying the curbs which
            hamper the cross section of knowledge, information sharing, and development industrially is where the
            digital environment is a highly required solution. The fact that digitalization has been changing and
            evolving the business surroundings and industrial sectors is definitely one of the first steps towards
            adapting to the new norms where “<em>digital</em>” is the key word towards leading a smarter and developed
            life.
        </p>
        <p class="nonindent">On focusing on the industrial sector, it can be inferred that smart factories are made
            smart and intelligent by using techniques and advanced technologies which are facilitated by digitalization
            and virtualization. However, just like how every coin has two sides, digitalization has a pullback too. The
            increase in the marketing competition would scale up to a completely different level with the factor of
            digitalization being introduced. Countries like Sweden aim towards transforming their nation into a global
            leader by adopting such smart and digital strategies for the industrial sector. This would also ensure that
            the functional implementation of strategies is highly organized and structured when compared to the plain
            old strategies which were used in the conventional plans. These notations cite that the digital environment
            is definitely a core foundation for both Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 for futuristic developments and smart
            and intelligent decisions and plans.</p>

        <p class="figcap" id="fig2_4"><strong>Figure 2.4:</strong> Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 leading to a digital
            environment</p>
        <p class="nonindent"><a id="page50" /><em><a href="#fig2_4">Figure 2.4</a></em> displays a number of dynamical
            concepts which show the significance of the main theme of this chapter. The rectangular box on the left-hand
            side shows how revolutionary changes have been incorporated in the societal and industrial platforms. With
            respect to societal transformation, the society has transformed from a hunting and gathering community to an
            agricultural society in Society 2.0 to an information technology and industrial focused-related society and
            a super smart society. Industrial society has transformed quite a lot during the four different phases,
            focusing on smarter, automated, and mechanized techniques during each progression. On comparing these two
            revolutionary concepts, it can be observed that the main core idea behind these is ultimately adapting to a
            digital transformation and utilizing the enhanced technological strategies for improvising living standards.
            This clearly shows how a digital environment places a core and foundational concept in uplifting the
            revolutionary concepts from both societal and industrial perspectives.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s59"><a href="toc.xhtml#s59a">Future scope</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">The field of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0 in a digitalized environment has a plethora of
            opportunities and large-scale scopes with regards to researches, analyses, and surveys. These concepts will
            be heard of more commonly and will gradually be adapted, thus transforming the lifestyle of the global
            society and the industrial sector. With such a huge potential platform in hand, one of the major points of
            discussion for researchers would be to dwell more on the topic of how different techniques of AI, ML, CPS,
            and so on can be utilized and exploited to extract proper benefits for revolutionary changes. Another
            possible area of research in the future would be with regards to the security and privacy issues connected
            to the same. Since digitalization with respect to a revolutionizing society and industry deals with a large
            amount of data extraction, manipulation and handling, there are plausible threats to securing them. In
            today’s world where cyber-attacks and data leakages are extremely common, one of the major concerns to be
            addressed would be with regards to preserving the security and privacy of data. This field opens up a large
            space for discussion and research in the future. Another field of possible research would be the efficient
            utilization of devices and machines in the industrial sector in order to extract maximum profits and yields
            through a smart, less cumbersome, and enhanced technique.</p>
        <p class="nonindent">Furthermore, there will be a number of implications and complex perspectives to look into
            especially after the outbreak of the global pandemic caused by corona virus. However, analyses have stated
            that the services and concepts put fourth during the societal revolution and industrial revolution have been
            of great advantage in order to overcome the curbs and challenges humanity faced while struggling towards
            striking a balance between professional, educational, financial, and medical walks of life. Digitalization
            and proliferation of the digital environment is sure to upscale and reach a massive audience from all across
            the globe, especially after <a id="page51" />the slow down (less affect) of the virus outbreak. This would
            surely allow people to adapt to the new norms, changes and virtualization, and transform along with the
            transformation of Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0. In fact, it can be observed that digitalization provides a
            platform for the nourishment of revolutionary societies and industries while Society 5.0 and Industry 4.0
            complement the existence of such a fruitful environment. However, there are a number of precautionary steps
            and implications to be incorporated while looking forward to a super smart society and industry post COIVD
            times. This is definitely plausible research for the future. In the end, we suggest articles of Tyagi et
            al., (2019) (2020) to refer for knowing more about IoTs, <strong>Internet of Everything</strong>
            (<strong>IoEs</strong>) and their possible extension with other technologies like AI, Blockchain, etc., in
            detail.</p>
        <h1 class="sec1" id="s60"><a href="toc.xhtml#s60a">Conclusion</a></h1>
        <p class="nonindent">To conclude, it can be stated that Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0 is all about realizing and
            forming a coherent and smart society which not only just paves for an innovative future personally but also
            brings across significant changes in the industrial sector too. In other words, these revolutionary concepts
            aim towards bringing about economic as well as technological developments and growths from multiple walks of
            life. Countries like Japan have already laid foundational steps towards adopting such concepts and are
            leading the world to follow the same. The adaptation of these revolutionary frameworks would ensure a
            holistic growth of countries across the world ensuring a status of development with optimized results. The
            main key value focused throughout this chapter is ‘<em>digitalization of the services</em>’ or creating a
            ‘<em>smart environment</em>’. The digital environment which is curated by adopting Society 5.0 and Industry
            4.0 are massive and will be the spotlight for research and development in the near future.</p>
