    <h2>2.1 Historical Background</h2>
    <p>
        The 8051 microcontroller, introduced by Intel in 1980, marked a significant milestone in the world of
        microprocessors. Its development was a response to the growing demand for a versatile and efficient
        microcontroller that could cater to various embedded system applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the years, the 8051 microcontroller became a standard in the industry, finding its place in a wide range of
        devices, from household appliances to industrial machinery. Its historical significance lies in its role as a
        pioneering microcontroller that set the stage for further advancements in embedded systems.
    </p>

    <h2>2.2 Architecture of 8051 Microcontroller</h2>
    <p>
        The architecture of the 8051 microcontroller is characterized by its Harvard architecture, distinguishing between
        program memory and data memory. This separation allows simultaneous access to program instructions and data,
        contributing to enhanced performance in control-oriented applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        At its core, the 8051 microcontroller comprises a Central Processing Unit (CPU), Random Access Memory (RAM),
        Read-Only Memory (ROM), and a variety of peripheral devices. The CPU, known as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit),
        executes instructions fetched from program memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the notable features of the 8051 architecture is its emphasis on I/O (Input/Output) operations. The
        microcontroller provides a range of ports for interfacing with external devices, making it highly adaptable for
        diverse applications.
    </p>

    <h2>2.3 Features and Specifications</h2>
    <p>
        The 8051 microcontroller is celebrated for its rich set of features and specifications, making it a preferred
        choice in the realm of embedded systems. Some of the key features include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>8-bit CPU with a wide range of instructions</li>
        <li>4 KB of on-chip ROM for program storage</li>
        <li>128 bytes of on-chip RAM for data storage</li>
