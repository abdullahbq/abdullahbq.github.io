    <title>Intel 8086 Architecture</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      The Intel 8086 microprocessor, introduced in 1978, marked a significant
      advancement in the x86 architecture. Here's a comprehensive overview of
      its architecture, highlighting key features and functionalities.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Bus and Address Bus:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 features a 16-bit data bus, allowing it to process data in 16-bit
      chunks. This wide data bus contributes to its ability to handle larger
      volumes of data efficiently. The address bus is also 16 bits wide,
      enabling the processor to address up to 2^16 (64 KB) memory locations,
      providing a substantial addressable memory space.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Registers:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 architecture includes various registers, crucial for data
      manipulation and storage. Four general-purpose registers (AX, BX, CX, DX)
      are each 16 bits long. These registers can be accessed as two 8-bit
      registers (AH and AL, BH and BL, CH and CL, DH and DL), providing
      versatility in handling different data types.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the 8086 includes registers like the stack pointer (SP) and
      base pointer (BP), vital for managing the stack and data segments. The
      source index (SI) and destination index (DI) registers are used for data
      movement and manipulation operations.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Instruction Pointer (IP):</h2>
    <p>
      The IP register holds the offset address of the next instruction to be
      executed. Together with the code segment register (CS), it forms a 20-bit
      physical address for instruction fetching. This segmentation approach
      allows the 8086 to access a larger memory space by combining the 16-bit
      offset with the 16-bit segment address.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Segment Registers:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 includes four segment registers: Code Segment (CS), Data Segment
      (DS), Stack Segment (SS), and Extra Segment (ES). These registers play a
      crucial role in memory addressing, determining the base address for
      different types of data and code segments.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Addressing Modes:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 supports various addressing modes, allowing flexible operand
      addressing. Common addressing modes include register addressing, immediate
      addressing, direct addressing, and indirect addressing. This flexibility
      enhances the versatility of the microprocessor in handling different types
      of instructions and operands.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU):</h2>
    <p>
      The heart of the 8086 is its Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU), responsible
      for executing arithmetic and logic operations. The ALU operates on 16-bit
      data and supports a rich set of instructions, including addition,
      subtraction, multiplication, division, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Control Unit:</h2>
    <p>
      The Control Unit manages the execution of instructions by coordinating
      various components of the processor. It interprets instructions from
      memory and directs the operation of the ALU, registers, and other
      functional units. The Control Unit plays a crucial role in ensuring the
      orderly execution of programs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Interrupts and Exception Handling:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 supports interrupt-driven I/O and exception handling. Interrupts
      allow the processor to respond to external events or requests, providing a
      mechanism for efficient I/O operations. The 8086 architecture includes an
      Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to manage interrupt vectors and exception
      handling.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Memory Management:</h2>
    <p>
      Memory management in the 8086 involves the use of segmentation. The
      combination of segment registers and the instruction pointer allows the
      processor to access a more extensive memory space. The 8086 can address up
      to 1 MB of memory, making it suitable for a range of applications.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Instruction Set:</h2>
    <p>
      The 8086 instruction set is rich and diverse, offering a wide range of
      operations for data manipulation, control flow, and I/O operations.
      Instructions are encoded in machine language and can be categorized into
      various groups, including data transfer, arithmetic, logical, control
      transfer, and string manipulation instructions.
