    <p>
      The microprocessor, a crucial component of modern computing, has undergone
      significant evolution since its inception. It has played a pivotal role in
      shaping the world of electronics and computing. Let's take a journey
      through the key stages of the microprocessor's evolution.
    </p>
    <h2>1. Introduction to Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of a microprocessor emerged in the early 1970s. Intel
      introduced the first microprocessor, the 4004, in 1971. It was a 4-bit
      processor designed for basic tasks. Soon after, the 8008 and 8080
      processors followed, marking the beginning of a new era in computing.
    </p>
    <h2>2. The 8-bit Era</h2>
    <p>
      The 8-bit microprocessor era saw the rise of processors like the Intel
      8088 and Motorola 6800. These processors had increased processing power
      and memory capabilities compared to their predecessors. The 8-bit
      architecture became the standard for personal computers in the late 1970s
      and early 1980s.
    </p>
    <h2>3. The 16-bit and 32-bit Advancements</h2>
    <p>
      As computing demands grew, the industry transitioned to 16-bit processors.
      Intel's 8086 and 80286 were prominent in this era. The 32-bit era followed
      with processors like the Intel 80386 and Motorola 68020, offering improved
      performance and multitasking capabilities.
    </p>
    <h2>4. The Rise of RISC Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture gained popularity in
      the late 1980s. Processors like IBM's POWER and ARM's designs embraced
      RISC principles, focusing on a simplified instruction set for increased
      speed and efficiency.
    </p>
    <h2>5. The Multicore Revolution</h2>
    <p>
      In the 21st century, the emphasis shifted towards multicore processors.
      Manufacturers started integrating multiple processing cores on a single
      chip, enhancing parallel processing capabilities. This approach
      significantly improved overall system performance.
    </p>
    <h2>6. Modern Microprocessors</h2>
    <p>
      Today, microprocessors continue to evolve with advanced technologies like
      64-bit architecture, nanotechnology, and improved power efficiency.
      Processors from companies like Intel, AMD, and ARM power a wide range of
      devices, from smartphones to supercomputers.

        <li>
          Intel introduced its first 4-bit microprocessor, the 4004, in 1971,
          and its 8-bit microprocessor, the 8008, in 1972. However, these
          microprocessors faced challenges as general-purpose processors due to
          their design and performance limitations.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The breakthrough came with the launch of the first general-purpose
          8-bit microprocessor, the 8080, in 1974 by Intel. This event is
          considered a major stepping stone toward the development of more
          advanced microprocessors.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The subsequent release of the microprocessor 8085, building upon the
          8080 with added features, resulted in a functionally complete
          microprocessor. Despite these improvements, 8-bit microprocessors
          still had limitations such as low speed, limited memory addressing
          capability, a restricted number of general-purpose registers, and a
          less powerful instruction set.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          All these limitations of the 8-bit microprocessors pushed the
          designers to build more powerful processors in terms of advanced
          architecture, more processing capability, larger memory addressing
          capability and a more powerful instruction set.
